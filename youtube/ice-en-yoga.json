Sign up TODAY for a free downloadable calendar and a daily email to help guide you on your journey. http://ywatrue.com\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\nWelcome! Thank you for joining for the 30 Days Of Yoga experience! Watch this video before you begin! For the free daily email, sign up here: http://yogawithadriene.com/30days/\n\nIt includes helpful ideas and tips to support you on your journey! Today we begin with this video! Tomorrow - DAY 1 of YOGA. \n\n As we transition into the New Year I already feel great about the idea of practicing for 30 days straight. I feel excited about challenging myself, connecting to myself and learning something new. I am grateful that my body is able to move, that my breath is capable of deepening and I love that I will be doing it with so many others, around the globe.\n \nThe hardest part each day will likely be getting on the mat. Make time. Stay focused and choose to make the experience your own. This 30 Day practice is intended to support you in finding what feels good in the New Year. So, though it may be challenging to make time for your practice – just do it – knowing that it is okay to adapt, change, modify, rebel and do your own thang at any time.\n\nBut get on the mat. \n\nTake conscious breaths and stretch each day as a way of connecting to your intentions, your big picture and ultimately, complete wellness.\n \nWhy not? Let's reach for the stars!\n\nGo Deeper with other goodies to support you on your journey + donation based downloadable versions of the videos so you can practice anytime, anywhere: https://gumroad.com/l/30DaysofYoga\n\nStay Connected ~ www.yogawithadriene.com\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/yogawithadriene\nTWITTER: @yogawithadriene\nINQUIRES: yogawithadriene@gmail.com\nInstagram: adrienelouise\n\nNamaste",

Forget What You Know About Yoga! It is so easy to slip into automatic pilot. For today's sequence, come into a beginners mind. (Bonus if you are a beginner and totally new to yoga!) When we come to this idea of beginner's mind - we open up to all possibilities.\n\nUse this Day 3 practice to check in with balance and connect to your core center. Let go of expectations and stay receptive as you work to build strength and unlock more space. Again, open up to making new discovery! If you are regular yogi this practice will be a great opportunity to change it up. If you are new to the practice, ROCK ON, you have that beautiful beginners mind already. Seek opportunities to learn - especially in the difficulties. Everyone, close your eyes when you can, move mindfully and trust yourself. Breathe. Breathe slowly. This revitalizing and strengthening sequence is great for balance, core & hip check in, and supports good posture! Explore where you are TODAY.\n\nThere are some more restorative practices on the way, I promise! Plus shorter sequences begin to weave in and out! Stick with it!! \n\nConnect and support others down below! Cultivate positivity. Remember each day is different! The journey is the reward!

Sign up TODAY for a free downloadable calendar and a daily email to help guide you on your journey. http://ywatrue.com\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\nJoin Adriene on Day 6 of The 30 Days of Yoga journey! Six Pack Abs! Yogi style. This is a shorter practice to tone the abdominals in a mindful way that feels fun and supportive! Also, almost everyone wants more core strength and tone abdominals. You asked for it!\nUse this Day 6 practice to check in with the core. Mindful core training will support your entire practice and whole body health. While tone abs are something we all fancy (me too) core strength training is so much more than washboard abs or a flat tummy. By building core strength you are supporting the the back and all of the muscles that surround your dear spinal cord. By working those muscles we are taking some of our weight off the spine and engaging the entire body. We are more likely to do active, engaging things when the body is strong & engaged. Great for runners, dancers, movers and shakers! Great for grounding the spirit.  \n\nConnect and support others down below! Cultivate positivity. Remember each day is different!
